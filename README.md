# GeoFS-METAR-system
A system that displays the nearest Airports' METAR data.
Please check for version updates frequently, as the current version is still unstable.
## How to use?
The widget will display the closest airport's METAR to you. It will auto-refresh every 30 minutes, and you can refresh manually as well.
After the verion 4.2.7, we don't need ap key anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## How to install?
Copy the user.js and paste it into Tampermonkey.
##How to use the converter?
Find the data in https://ourairports.com/, and paste the .csv into the converter (link: https://seabus0316.github.io/GeoFS-METAR-system/airport_csv_converter_v7.html
), press "convert", paste the code into airports.json, and upload to a public github repo, change the link in const airportDataURL = "your raw link here"
You can add airports customarily, but U have to create a repo, U can ask seabus. Also, I will also upload some airport collection packs here, and you don't have to update your userscript.
