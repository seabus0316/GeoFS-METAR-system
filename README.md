# GeoFS-METAR-system
A system that displays the nearest Airports' METAR data.
Please check for version updates frequently, as the current version is still unstable.
## How to use?
The widget will display the closest airport's METAR to you. It will auto-refresh every 30 minutes, and you can refresh manually as well.
After the verion 4.2.7, we don't need ap key anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## How to install?
Copy the user.js and paste it into Tampermonkey.
## Whats new in v4.3.0?
It's now FULL DATABASE!!!! and the data source changed into https://github.com/mwgg/Airports/blob/master/airports.json, It's a full database json.
And the metar data source will fall back to AVWX if Vatsim isn't available at this airport.
